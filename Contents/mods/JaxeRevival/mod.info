description=Instead of dying immediately, players enter an incapacitated state where they can be revived by others. Depending on adjustable rules, if left unattended for a certain period, incapacitated players will either recover or die, potentially suffering a loss of skills. Death can still occur if the player receives excessive damage or through standard mechanics such as zombification if such options are enabled.

description=This mod aims to make death less final and enhances immersion by suggesting that perhaps the virus affects players differently - rather than turning into zombies, they remain fully conscious while their bodies and organs gradually recover to a functional state.
